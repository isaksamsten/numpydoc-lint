# TODO

[x] Module docstring with comments before does not work.
[x] One line docstrings are always flagged as not first line
[ ] `__init__` missing docstring warning should be flagged on the class name.
[ ] Don't flag non-existing parameters as out-of-order.
[ ] Support multiple parameters on the same declaration
`x1, x2 : array-like`.
[x] Improve parsing of sections, so we can warn when the heading is not using
the exact case
[ ] Improve error message for parameter order.
